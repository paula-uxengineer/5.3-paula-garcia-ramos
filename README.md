>This project is a practical exercise designed to practice collections and documents using MongoDB.

### Level 1 
An optical store seeks to digitalize its customer management and eyewear sales process.

Incorporating MongoDB schema, the system captures supplier details like name, address, contact, and tax ID. Eyewear specifics such as brand, lens prescription, frame type, colors, and pricing are meticulously stored.

Customer records encompass name, postal address, contact information, email, and registration date. Additionally, the system tracks customer referrals and associates each eyewear sale with the responsible employee, timestamping the transaction.
